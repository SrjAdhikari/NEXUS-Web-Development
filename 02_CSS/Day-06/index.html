    <!--* Position Propery:
        ● The position property defines how an element is positioned in the document.
        ● The location of the positioned element is set with the four properties: top, left, right, and bottom.
    -->


    <!--* Types of Position Values:
        👉 Static :
            ● This is the default positioning for every element.
            ● Elements with position: static are positioned normally in the document flow (from top to bottom).
            ● The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect on static elements.

        👉 Relative :
            ● The element is positioned relative to its original (static) position.
            ● When we apply top, left, right, or bottom properties, it moves the element from its original position without affecting the layout of surrounding elements.

        👉 Absolute :
            ● The element is removed from the normal document flow.
            ● It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (not necessarily its immediate parent, but the closest ancestor that has position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
            ● If no positioned ancestor is found, the element is positioned relative to the document (viewport).

        👉 Fixed :
            ● The element is removed from the normal document flow.
            ● The element is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport).
            ● The element stays in the same position when you scroll the page.

        👉 Sticky :
            ● Elements with position: sticky are a mix between relative and fixed positioning.
            ● Acts as relative initially, and becomes fixed when it reaches a certain point on the page (usually when scrolling).
            ● The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine when the sticky behavior is triggered.
    -->


    <!--* Additional Positioning Properties:
        👉 top : Moves the element down from the top.
        👉 bottom : Moves the element up from the bottom
        👉 left : Moves the element right from the left.
        👉 right : Moves the element left from the right.
