    <!--* CSS Animation:
        ● CSS animations allow us to create moving effects by changing properties of elements over time.
        ● We can animate elements by setting CSS properties like position, opacity, transition or transform.
    -->

    <!--* Basic Concept of CSS Animation:
        ● CSS animations are defined in two main parts:
            1. @keyframes Rule – Defines the steps of the animation.
            2. Animation Properties – Applied to the element to control how the animation plays.
    -->

    <!--* The @keyframes Rule:
        👉 The @keyframes rule specifies the animation’s behavior at certain points (keyframes) during the sequence.

        👉 Syntax:
            @keyframes animation-name {
                from { }
                to { }
            }

            @keyframes animation-name {
                0% { /* starting state */ }
                50% { /* middle state */ }
                100% { /* ending state */ }
            }
    -->

    <!--* CSS Animation Properties:
        👉 animation-name: 
            ● Specifies the name of the @keyframes you created.
            ● Example: animation-name: slide;

        👉 animation-duration: 
            ● Specifies how long the animation takes (in seconds or milliseconds).
            ● Example: animation-duration: 5s;

        👉 animation-timing-function: 
            ● Defines the speed curve of the animation.
            ● Values: linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out
            ● Example: animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;

        👉 animation-delay: 
            ● Defines the amount of time to delay before the animation starts.
            ● Example: animation-delay: 2s;

        👉 animation-iteration-count: 
            ● Specifies the number of times an animation repeats.
            ● 1 means it plays once; infinite means it repeats indefinitely.
            ● Example: animation-iteration-count: infinite;

        👉 animation-direction: 
            ● Defines whether the animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.
            ● Values: 
                1. normal : plays forward.
                2. reverse : plays backward.
                3. alternate : plays forward, then backward.
                4. alternate-reverse : plays backward, then forward.
            ● Example: animation-direction: alternate;

        👉 animation-fill-mode: 
            ● Specifies what happens to the final keyframe when the animation is finished.
            ● Values: 
                1. none : not apply any styles to the element.
                2. forwards : apply the styles to the element at the end of the animation.
                3. backwards : apply the styles to the element at the start of the animation.
                4. both : apply the styles at the start and end of the animation.
            ● Example: animation-fill-mode: forwards;

        👉 Shorthand for Animation Properties:
            animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
