    <!--* CSS Grid:
        ● The CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows designers and developers to create complex and responsive layouts with ease.
    -->

    <!--* Grid Layout Terminologies:
        👉 Grid Container:
            ● The Grid container is a parent element that holds the grid items.
            ● To create a grid container, set display: grid; on the container.

        👉 Grid Items:
            ● Grid items are the direct children of the grid container.
            ● We can control the placement, size, and order of these grid items within the grid structure.

        👉 Grid Line:
            ● Grid Lines are the dividing lines that create rows and columns within the grid.
            ● Horizontal lines separate rows, and vertical lines separate columns.
            ● Grid lines are numbered starting from 1 (from left to right for columns, and from top to bottom for rows)

        👉 Grid Track:
            ● The grid track refers to the adjacent space between two grid lines.
            ● This can be vertical or horizontal space

        👉 Grid Area:
            ● Grid area refers to the space surrounded by four grid lines.
            ● A grid area can have any number of grid cells.
            ● We can name grid areas and place grid items within specific named areas.

        👉 Grid Cell:
            ● Grid cells are the individual units formed by the intersection of rows and columns.
            ● It is the space between two adjacent row and column grid lines.

        👉 Grid Gap:
            ● The grid gap refers to the space between the rows and columns in a grid.
            ● It is a shorthand property for setting row-gap and column-gap.

    <!--* Grid Container Properties:
        ● Specifying the Grid Rows and Columns:
            👉 display: grid -> Turns an HTML element into a grid container.
            👉 grid-template-columns : Defines the number and width of columns.
            👉 grid-template-rows : Defines the number and height of rows.
            👉 grid-template-areas : Defines named grid areas where the grid items can be placed.
            👉 grid-template : A shorthand for defining one property's rows, columns, and areas.

        ● Specifying the Grid Row and Column Gap:
            👉 grid-column-gap : Defines the space between columns.
            👉 grid-row-gap : Defines the space between rows.
            👉 grid-gap : A shorthand for defining both row and column gaps.

        ● Aligning the Grid:
            👉 justify-content : Aligns the grid horizontally within the container (start, end, center, space-between, space-around, etc.).
            👉 align-content : Aligns the grid vertically within the container (start, end, center, space-between, space-around, etc.).
            👉 place-content : A shorthand for aligning content both horizontally and vertically.

        ● Aligning the Grid Items:
            👉 justify-items : Aligns items horizontally (left, right, center, or stretch).
            👉 align-items : Aligns items vertically (top, bottom, center, or stretch).
            👉 place-items : A shorthand for aligning items both horizontally and vertically.

        ● Setting Automatic Grid Tracks:
            👉 grid-auto-columns : Defines the size of automatically generated columns.
            👉 grid-auto-rows : Defines the size of automatically generated rows.
            👉 grid-auto-flow : Defines the placement of auto-generated grid items.
