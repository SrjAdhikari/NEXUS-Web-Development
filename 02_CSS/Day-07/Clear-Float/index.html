    <!--* Clear Float:
        ● The clear property is used to prevent elements from wrapping around floated elements.
        ● It prevents elements from being wrapped around or adjacent to floated elements.
        ● Ensures elements appear below floated elements.
    -->


    <!--* Key Points:
        👉 clear: left -> Ensures the element moves below any floated elements on the left.
        👉 clear: right -> Ensures the element moves below floated elements on the right.
        👉 clear: both -> Ensures the element moves below any floating elements (both left and right)
        👉 clear: none is the default and allows floating.
