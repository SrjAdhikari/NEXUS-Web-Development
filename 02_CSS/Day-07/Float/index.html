    <!--* Float:
        ● The CSS float property is used to specify how an element floats within a parent element.
        ● The element can float to the right, left, or none within the container.
        ● The float property is mainly used for text wrapping around elements (images).
    -->


    <!--* Key Points:
        👉 float: left -> Makes the element float to the left of its container.
        👉 float: right -> Makes the element float to the right.
        👉 float: none is the default, meaning no floating occurs.
    -->
