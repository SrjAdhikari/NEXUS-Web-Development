    <!--* Overflow:
        ● The overflow property controls what happens to content when it overflows (i.e., exceeds) its container’s box. 
        ● It helps manage scrollbars or hiding content.
        ● Default value of overflow is visible.
    -->


    <!--* Key Points:
        👉 overflow: visible -> Content that overflows the container is fully visible (default behavior).
        👉 overflow: hidden -> Content that overflows is cut off (hidden) and not visible.
        👉 overflow: scroll -> Adds scrollbars (both horizontal and vertical) even if the content fits within the container.
        👉 overflow: auto -> Adds scrollbars only if the content overflows.
    -->
