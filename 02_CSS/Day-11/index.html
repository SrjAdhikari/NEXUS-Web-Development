    <!--* Flex Items:
        ● Flex items are children elements inside the flex container.
        ● These items will be positioned and aligned based on the container’s flex properties.
    -->


    <!--* FlexItem Properties: 
        👉 order (Controls Item Placement) :
            ● Defines the order in which the item is positioned within the flex container without altering the HTML structure.
            ● Default: 0 (all items have the same order by default and appear as per the HTML structure).

            ● Items with lower order values appear earlier.
            ● Items with higher order values appear later.
            ● If two items have the same order, they keep the order defined in the HTML structure.


        👉 flex-grow (Controls Item Growth) : 
            ● Defines how much a flex item should grow relative to other items when extra space is available in the container.
            ● Default: 0 (items don’t grow by default)
            ● If one item has flex-grow: 1 and another has flex-grow: 2, the second item will grow twice as much as the first one if there’s extra space in the container.


        👉 flex-shrink (Controls Item Shrinking) : 
            ● Controls how much a flex item should shrink relative to other items when there isn’t enough space in the container. 
            ● Default: 1 (items will shrink if needed)
            ● If one item has flex-shrink: 1 and another has flex-shrink: 0, the first item will shrink if needed, but the second won’t shrink at all.


        👉 flex-basis (Defines Item’s Initial Size) : 
            ● Sets the initial size of a flex item before any space distribution happens based on flex-grow or flex-shrink.
            ● Default: auto (item’s content width or height determines its size)
            ● flex-basis defines the item’s starting size, and then the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties adjust the item’s size from there.
            ● If flex-basis is set to 0, the item won’t have an initial size, and flex-grow and flex-shrink will entirely determine its size.


        👉 align-self (Aligns Individual Item Along Cross Axis) : 
            ● Allows you to override the align-items property for an individual item, aligning it differently from the rest.
            ● Default: auto (item’s cross axis alignment)
            ● If the container’s align-items is set to flex-start, but you set one item’s align-self to center, that item will be centered along the cross axis, while the other items are at the start.


        👉 flex (Shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis) : 
            ● The flex property is a shorthand that combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis into a single line.
            ● Syntax: flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis];
